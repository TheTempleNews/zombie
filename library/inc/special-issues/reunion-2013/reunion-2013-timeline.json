Even more galling was the committee telling us not to run a negative story and dispensing not-so-veiled threats that they wouldn’t cooperate with the newspaper if we did.

So my assistant sports editor, John Kopp, and I went to work on what would be an eight-page pullout section. We banked quotes from fellow top NCAA coaches as the season went on in order to build a ‘What they’re saying’ column. We assembled a timeline of Chaney’s career. We prepared a mainbar, reached out to former players for complimentary sidebars and pulled file and present-day photos for a picture page. The finished product, like most seasons the Owls played with Chaney on the bench, was a success.</blockquote><p>&mdash;Christopher Vito, Sports Editor, 2006&ndash;07</p>",
